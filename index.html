Secondly, I expect I can find out my direction. For example, I want to make a new game, but the question is which kind of game do I want to make, FPS or MMO? In consequence, I hope I can learn some knowledge to solve my questions through this wonderful University studies. Thirdly, obviously, I need to find out some my favourite jobs through my Bachelor's degree.</p>
